description: "To fully understand the appeal of a Crane Bell, you have to hear its sublime sound: Crisp, clear and bright, it's loud enough to clear a path, yet elegant enough to be polite. Flick the spring-loaded lever with your thumb and you hear a sharp tone that lingers for a bit, or use a lighter touch for a quieter ring."
